# Welcome üòÅ
Today we will put what we've learned about HTML into practice! <br>
HTML is a foundational building block to making your own websites<br>

<h3><b>What is HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)?</b></h3>
HTML is kind of like the concrete foundation of a house it's the structure.<br>
An HTML element consists of an opening tag <b>< p ></b>  and a closing tag. <b>< / p ></b><br>
These elements can have <b>attributes</b> for example: < html <b>lang="en" ></b> which defines the language of the document as english.<br>
Your task today will be to modify the html document above to have your name, age, and a little bit about what you like to do.<br>
To get stated clone the repository to your local machine or edit the code directly in GitHub. 
<h3> Bonus points if you can change the images to your favourite animals!</h3>
